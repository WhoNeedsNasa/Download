This game allows children to safely interact with ICT's in order to develop necessary skills.  \r\n\r\n* The Game is a 2D running based game.  The Idea was from the original Super Mario game, and I believe it will be a great start for someone who doesn't have access to a Nintendo console.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### The game is still In Alpha stage and will only feature 1 level.  \r\n\r\n\r\n# Download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzjOH1wI9XGgOGxBelNKSzVyazg/view?usp=sharing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
